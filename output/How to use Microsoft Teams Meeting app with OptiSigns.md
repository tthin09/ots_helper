Make sure you set "Who can bypass the lobby" to "Everyone".

Otherwise OptiSigns app will stuck at the lobby.

Now you can assign this MS Teams Meeting app to your screens, or put it on a schedule so the screens will join automatically when the meeting start.

The screens will join the meeting as Guests with names are the name of the screens.

This can also be done with Teams Town hall. To enable Town hall, simply hit **Share Event**, then copy the **Join** **link** URL and paste this into OptiSigns.

**Tips:**

Have the host start the meeting a few mins before screens are joining automatically.\
It will take a device 10-15s to join the meeting, so it's not a good idea to put the Teams Meeting in a playlist. It's better to use it as single asset to take up full screen or be part of a [SplitScreen zone](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).
