## **That's all! Congratulation!**

You have created your Facebook Live Stream app.

You can assign it to your screen by going to Screens, click Edit screens and assign the wall to screens that you want.

## **Note:**

Facebook Live Stream URL will become a video on demand once the stream is finished.\
So if the stream is already finished, the OptiSigns still get the video and plays it.\
If you are following a Facebook Live Stream channel, each new stream session is a new link, so you will have to copy, update the link every time.\
If you are producing live streams on Facebook, you can create, schedule the link ahead of time.\
