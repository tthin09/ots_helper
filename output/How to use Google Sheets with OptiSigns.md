#### Additional Features

After creating your asset, your URL box will now have a **"Refresh Data"** button. This button will update your Google Sheets data to make sure the latest information is shown on your device when clicked.

When you update your Sheet, Google will also send a notification to our system, which will either update the new data automatically after 5 minutes, during the set Force Sync Interval, or when you click the Refresh Data button above.

**Copy this** **published link** → Return to your Google Sheets app in the OptiSigns portal.

**Set up Update Interval:** You can specify in seconds, how often the app should check for updated sheets:

* **Default/Minimum:** 600 seconds
* 0 means it will only check your data when it loads the first time.

Once done, click **Save**.

## Limitations

* **Update Intervals:**
  + **Private Sheet:**Google will notify our system when you update your Sheet, and we will reload the information in as little as 5 minutes, up to one hour (or whenever you set your Force Sync Interval).
  + **Published Sheet:** Google updates the webpage automatically every 5 minutes. Your screens should then update in around 5-10 minutes, up to the Force Sync interval (minimum 1 hour).
* **Hidden Sheet:** If you try to import a hidden Sheet, we will not be able to access the content. This will cause the Preview window or Screens to display as black.
* **Custom Display Region:**
  + Currently, it is only supported for Private Sheet.
  + This must be set up during the creation of the asset. Once this is selected for an asset, it cannot be unselected. Or, if you do not select it upon creating the asset, you cannot select it later.
  + If you set up Custom Display Region, you can always adjust the inputted cells and scaling.
