## Design Differences in Designer 2.0

### Left-Aligned Side Menu

The biggest change for users will be the look and placement of functions in Designer 2.0. The new version streamlines the design, left-aligning a lot of the previous buttons and functions.

Most functions are now relocated to the left-hand side.

![Designer screenshot highlighting toolbar](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432408655379)

The left side menu will also replace the pop-up window that was utilized for certain functions.

The functions now in the left side menu include:

* Position
* Layers, formerly called “Objects”
* Data Sources
* Animation
* Widget format options
* Settings
* Text
* And more

For example, Animations controls will now appear in the left side menu.

![Designer screenshot with two black shapes in the design, arrows show how to use animation](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432408656403)

### Effects

Effects is the new category for accessing visual effects. This includes some of our previous functions, such as Shadow, Outline, Texture, Gradient, and Opacity.

To access these functions:

* **Select** Effects
* **Choose** any of the functions from the side menu

![Designer screenshot with two shapes in the design, arrows show how to apply visual effects](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432408657043)

### Layers

Similarly, Objects has been renamed to Layers and moved to the left-hand side menu. This allows you to edit the positioning or layering of any of the elements of your design.

To access Layers:

* Select the **layered icon** on the right side
* OR select **Position**
* Select **Layers**

Then you can select any of the elements and move them around to change their position or "layering."

![Designer screenshot of purple design with a girl and white letters, arrows show how to use Layers](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432385843347)

### History

This new feature allows you to track all your most recent changes to your design.

Careful! Clicking on a previous “event” and starting to make changes to your design will erase any events  created after that specific event.

To access History:

* Select the **layered icon** on the right side
* OR select **Position** button from the t0ol bar
* **History** is the right option that will pop up in the side menu
* **Click** any event to move to that point in your editing

![Designer screenshot of purple design with a girl and white letters, arrows show how to use History function](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432385843731)

### Canvas Resize Options

We have added Landscape and Portrait options to the Resizing option for greater ease of use. This allows you to reshape your canvas and design with a click of a button. Made the design in landscape but you need it for a screen in portrait mode? No worries!

* Select **Resize**from the tool bar
* Deselect **Maintain Aspect Ratio**
* Select **Portrait** or **Landscape**

## New Exciting Features in Designer 2.0

### Reusable Component Library

This feature allows you to save any design element or grouped elements to a component library. Save any element you like and create a library of branded or themed elements, or simply one that you wanted to save for later!

To add the component:

* Click on **the element** you would like to save
* Select **More**
* Select **Add Component**

To access the components:

* Click on **Your Temp** from the left side bar
* Click on **Components**

You will now be able to add to any design!

This works with elements or designs you create, whole templates from our library, or single elements from a template.

![Designer screenshot with a yellow and white design, features arrows showing how to save elements](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432385845523)

### Scale Repeater Images

New scaling options are available for images in Repeaters. You are now able to select Fit, Zoom, or Stretch to have it better fit your design.

To customize the image size in a Repeater to your preference:

* Select the **repeater image**
* Select **Settings**
* Select **Scale**
* Choose **Fit, Stretch, or Zoom**

**![Designer screenshot featuring a picture and arrows showing how to resize image](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432385847571)**

### Background Remover

Automatically detects and removes backgrounds from images. It currently only supports auto-removal and at present it is not possible to custom erase or restore the background.

To remove the background:

* Select **Background Remover** from the tool bar
* Wait for the **loading icon** to finish
* Click **Save**

 Afterwards, it will simply disappear!

### Image Masking

Our new tool allows you to apply shapes or elements as masks to images.

* Click on the **Mask** icon from the tool bar
* Select any **shape** or search for more shapes on the left side menu

![Designer screenshot with image of lion cub in grass cut into a circle shape, arrows show how to apply mask](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432408670227)

The mask and the image attach automatically when you select it.

To edit the placement on the picture, **Edit Mask** detaches the overlaid shape.

**Apply Mask** reapplies it and groups it back together.

To delete the shape altogether, select **Remove Mask**.

### Google Font Weights Support

We now have full font weight options for our Google Fonts (for example, Thin, Light, Regular, Bold).

Note: This is only available for Google Fonts.

![Screenshot of font weight options and applied font weight to Heading 1 text](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432385849363)

To change the font weight:

* **Select** the text you would like to change or add a text box
* **Click** the font name on the tool bar
* **Choose** a font from the left side menu

If the font you choose is a Google font, the options will drop down underneath the font name.

![Screenshot of Designer featuring text options, arrows show how to change font and font weight](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432385851155)

### Copy and Apply Style

This function allows you to easily copy and paste style settings, such as font, size, color, and effects, between elements.

This works for both text and shape elements.

To change the style:

* **Select** the text or shape you would like to copy
* **Click** the Copy Style icon from the tool bar
* **Drag** the icon to the text you would like to change

1. ![Designer screenshot with yellow and blue text over plain text, arrows show how to copy text style](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432385851667)

2. ![Screenshot of yellow and blue text](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432408676755)

### Text Case Options

Now you can quickly convert text between uppercase, lowercase, sentence case, and title case for all kinds of styles.

To use:

* **Add** a text box or select the text you’d like to modify
* **Click** on Text Case
* **Select** the text case of your choice

![Designer screenshot of tool bar, arrow points to text case icon](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432408677395)

### Pan Tool

This allows you to pan around the canvas without moving design elements. This is useful if you are zoomed in on your design and would like to move to another part of the canvas without disturbing any of your elements.

* **Select** the hand icon on your right side menu
* **Use** the hand to move the design
* **Unclick** the hand when you are finished

![Designer screenshot with dark and light brown background, arrow pointing to hand icon](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432408677779)

### Excel Date Format

We have corrected the issue where dates appear as serial numbers in DataSources. However, you must recreate the Excel file as a new DataSource for the fix to take effect.

To learn more about adding Excel spreadsheets as DataSources, please reference [How to Set Up Dynamic Data Mapping](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync) and [Add an Excel Spreadsheet as a DataSource](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29863080711059-How-to-add-a-Microsoft-365-Excel-Spreadsheet-as-a-DataSource-for-OptiSync).
