# How to Control and Schedule Playlist Items

It's possible to apply schedules to individual Playlist items. This feature is now available on Windows, Linux, Android, and ChromeOS devices.

You can apply it for these 2 use cases:

* You can use the "Apply To" setting if you want to apply some restrictions on the playlist items so that the item will only play on certain screens or not play on certain screens. With this feature, you can mix content for different screens in the same playlist, and the management of the screen will be much simpler. For example, you have a global playlist that is applied to all the screens, and there is an item that is only relevant for one region, using this feature you can simply put it in the global playlist, and just set it to apply to the region only. (Pro+ plan required)
* You can use the "Item Schedule" setting to set the schedule for individual playlist items. With this feature, you can set a schedule for an individual playlist item, and have different items scheduled at different times of day, and different days of the week. For example, if there is an item that is only supposed to be played in the morning of a weekday, you can set up the schedule for the playlist item accordingly, the item will only play during the scheduled time.
