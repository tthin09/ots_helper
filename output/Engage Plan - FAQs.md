**How much is it?**

Engage plan is $30/mo/screen. With an annual plan, that cost is reduced to $27/mo/screen.

**Only some of my Screens need Engage features. Can I only buy Engage Subscriptions for them?**

Since Engage includes platform-wide features (QR Scan to Interact, Check-in & SMS, analytics data, etc.), it cannot be separately billed by screens. We suggest:

* If you have fewer than 25 screens that need to be on Engage, you can create a new account and manage only your Engage screens there.
* If you have more than 25 screens to be on Engage and need to mix-use them with your regular signage-only screens, you can [talk to our Sales team.](https://share.hsforms.com/1r9KTTxPFSYijx-DVR6I7nwca5m5)

**Does SMS messaging cost extra?**

500 SMS per Engage screen subscription is included. That is enough for ~300 check-ins, depending on how your users respond.

Additional SMS are billed at $0.025 per message
