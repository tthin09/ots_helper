## Introduction

Sometimes, you need to re-use a playlist inside another playlist. This feature is called a nested playlist or sub-playlist.

| Nested Playlists are available to **[Standard plan](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing)**users and above. |

For example, there may be a need for a common or global playlist that you want for all of your screens but require there to be some exceptions for regional-specific content to also be shown. Nested Playlists allow you to be able to manage that in an organized manner.

This article assumes you already know how to [create and use Playlists](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/28295104605843) with OptiSigns. \

## Let's dive in:

In this example, we have a Global Playlist that has corporate-level content, and we have Regional playlist where it needs to play the Global Playlist content plus some localized content.

To add an existing Global Playlist into the new Regional playlist, you can navigate to the Playlist tab.

Click "Add Playlist" button

Select the playlist you want to add as nested playlist.\
In this case it's the Global Playlist.\
Then click Add.

Now you can see your Global Playlist inside your Regional playlist.\
You can move the order of the Global Playlist just like any other playlist items.

That's it, you can now assign this Regional playlist to any screens and it will play contents in the order as arranged.

Just like other playlist items, you can set limit duration of the Child playlist in the Parent playlist (to control how long this item will be played).\
If the child playlist duration is shorter than this duration, it will be repeated till this duration is done.\
If the child playlist duration is longer than this duration, it will get cut off at this duration.

**Note:**About playlist transition.

If you set specific transition for playlist items in Global, this transition setting will remain.
