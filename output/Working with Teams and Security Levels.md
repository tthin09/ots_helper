# Working with Teams and Security Levels

With OptiSigns, you can set up Teams, invite other users / account members and set security levels.\
Team(like workspace) is built for segregation, all the resources (Screens, Assets, Users etc) in a team are segregated from other teams. Account owner will have access to all the teams, if you need to act as a global administrator and have access to all the teams, you can use the Super Admin role for that purpose.

| Teams can only be added under the **Pro Plus****plan**or above. Free and Standard plan users can still Add/Invite members to the Default team. |

This article will guide you through how to work with Teams, and set security for your account.

**Quick start:**

* Teams: You can organize our account by Teams.
  + Each team can have multiple members, and their own screens, files, assets, etc. Other teams cannot see another team's data.
  + Admins can allocate # of screens quota to each team.
* Team members:
  + Admins can invite users to be members of teams. Team members can work on team's screen, files, assets, etc.
  + One users can belong to more than 1 team, and can switch around to manage screens of the teams they are assigned to.
* Security level: there are 2 security levels
  + Admin: can add, remove users to teams
  + User: can work on the team's screens, files, assets, etc. but cannot see subscription, billing information.
