## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does using Outlook or Office 365 Calendar require giving OptiSigns Admin permission to use?

OptiSigns uses Microsoft APIs for integration. In order for our integrations to work, the integration has to be approved by an administrator. This is the same across all integrations using Microsoft APIs.

This administrator access is only needed for first time access. Once the OptiSigns app is approved for use, other users can use OptiSigns directly.

### I can't find the calendar I want to display. Why not?

A limitation of the integration is that OptiSigns can only display what is tied to a given Microsoft account. This means that any calendars shared with that account or present in Microsoft Rooms cannot be displayed.

To fix this, you can change the calendar directory from Rooms to a personal one. First, find the calendar you wish to display, then hit the **3-dot icon**and navigate to **Remove**:

Next, hit **Add Calendar**. Find the calendar from the directory you wish to display, then add it to **My Calendars:**

Now, the appropriate calendar should display once it's been recreated in OptiSigns.
