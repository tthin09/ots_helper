# Does OptiSigns offer Non-profit/Education discount?

Yes, we are supportive of those in non-profit organizations and the education field.

For non-profit or education organizations, we offer a flat 10% discount on subscriptions. This discount does not apply to hardware.

To obtain this discount, send us an email request to [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com) with your organization's website and documentation for us to verify. This documentation must prove your organization's tax-exempt status. Typically, this is a 501c3 document, but it can be anything that indicates your organization is tax-exempt.

Once verified, we will apply the discount to your account going forward.

If you have any additional questions, concerns, or any feedback about OptiSigns, feel free to reach out to our support team at [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com)
