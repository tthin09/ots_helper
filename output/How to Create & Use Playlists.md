| **NOTE** |
| If you're new to OptiSigns, you'll be using one of two interfaces: the **1.0** interface, or the **2.0** interface. For your convenience, we've provided screenshots of each. |

## Let's Get Started:

You can add various types of content to your playlists, including images, videos, web links, and apps. These items can be mixed and matched in any order and duration.

**1.** First, you will need to **create an asset** from your [Files/Assets page](https://app.optisigns.com/app/assetManagement) to add content to your playlist.

**2.** Alternatively, you can click the '**Playlists**' tab, then on the right side, click '**New**.' From there, you can either create an asset or upload files, templates, or feeds.

**Example:**

## **How to Create a Playlist**

**1.** To create a playlist, navigate to "**Playlist**" on the top navigation bar.\
**2.** Click "**Create Playlist**".
