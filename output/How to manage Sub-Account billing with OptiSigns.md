# How to manage Sub-Account billing with OptiSigns

OptiSigns supports managing billing for sub-accounts. With this feature, headquarters/corporate can manage the billing & payment on behalf of the subsidiaries, like franchisees or different departments. For example, a branch manages the account and screens on its own, but corporates can set up the subaccount and add payment methods for local branches.\
\
**Important Note**: Sub-account is a separate account, so **screens**, **contents**, **playlists,** and **schedules** are segregated in the subaccount. The sub-account billing feature is only to support the main account to manage the billing and payment for the sub-account.

If you would like to manage the recourses in the "sub-account" instead, we suggest that you use the "[**Teams**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034883113)" feature so that you can reserve the screens per team, and then allocate the cost by the number of screens.

If you are a very large franchise or, organizations that need over 50+ sub-accounts, please reach out to us we have a team billing feature that may be more suitable for you.
