# How to use YouTube Live Schedule with OptiSigns

A real world scenario would be:

A church has scheduled a video to go live on Sunday morning at 9 o'clock through YouTube Live. If the main hall is filled, the church has overflow rooms with televisions, screens for signage, and presentations. You can use the OptiSigns YouTube Live schedule feature to schedule a live session to broadcast in the overflow rooms every Sunday 9AM automatically.

Putting YouTube Live Schedule on your digital signs screens is easy with OptiSigns.\
You just need to copy the YouTube channel link and paste in the YouTube Live Schedule app and select the schedule.\
**Note: To use the app, Youtube Channel URL is required. The format is like below**

**https://www.youtube.com/channel/Your-Channel-Id\
To get your channel Id, go to the about page of your channel, click on share channel and copy channel Id.**

## **Tips & Notes:**

You should set your event in YouTube to live a few minutes before the actual schedule time in OptiSigns, as YouTube take a few mins to set the event live.

If you set your event to be live publicly (so people can view it without logging on to YouTube), it may take up to 10min from the time you set the event to Live till the time it's actually live on YouTube (likely due to YouTube review process).  

## **That's all! Congratulation!**

You have added a YouTube Live Schedule.

You can assign the newly created YouTube Live Schedule asset to your screen by going to Screens, click Edit screens and assign the wall to screens that you want.

You can put the YouTube Live Schedule to a Playlist, Schedule too.
