# How to Delete Your Account from OptiSigns

When you delete your account, all your data, images, videos, assets, playlists, schedules, proof of play, etc. will be permanently deleted. Please do so with caution.

After your account is deleted, you can sign up again with the same username.

### To request the permanent deletion of your account:

Before deleting your account, you may want to log in and download a copy of your information (like your images and Designer assets) from OptiSigns. After your account has been deleted, you will not have access to your account.

* Go to the [Company Setting](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/company-profile) page from a browser.
