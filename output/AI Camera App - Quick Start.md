# AI Camera App - Quick Start

OptiSigns AI Camera app that allows you to use any camera, plug into the device playing OptiSigns Digital Signage player to:

1. Detect and collect data about passing by foot traffic to analyze impressions and exposure of your Digital Sign.

2. Responsively display different content based on demographic of viewers standing in front of your screens.

This feature is supported on [Linux](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034379573-Linux), [Windows](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034379293-Windows), and [Android Device](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004585601-OptiSigns-Pre-Configured-Android-Device).

**1.) Preparation:**

If you haven't paired a device yet, follow this guide [for Windows](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034379293-Windows), or this guide [for Linux](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034379573) or [Raspberry Pi](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034379693) to install and run OptiSigns Digital Signage Player first.

**You must have the OptiSigns' Engage Subscription or Trial to access the AI Camera feature.**

Each account is entitled to use the AI Camera feature on **ONE FREE** screen. If you would like to add the AI Camera feature to more than 1 screen, you will need to purchase the Engage subscription.

Here is a link to the [subscription page](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=**LP%20-%20TM%20-%20General&gad_source=1&tm=tt&gclid=CjwKCAjw17qvBhBrEiwA1rU9wzdWIAakpk0mIXEg3OpcP4QnrL-GRU2ZyQ5wF16D9CNUBDIXeQfZJxoCfXkQAvD_BwE&aaid=adaoPCrtgEgFw).

Get a USB Camera and plug into your device:

We recommend the Logitech Webcams like the [C270](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Desktop-Widescreen-Calling-Recording/dp/B004FHO5Y6/ref=sr_1_2?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xTkSg8MY4kb9MLTupXquWb1yd2NRogWqCSAv6prNcI09Cg4SXj4qfME1YR36PDpBODSThuLo3EPLSG2yFWB3XffZZAefDL1sF5SHE2hY8oVDBSRNaM-sD9zqv9mMWAHCyTa7yVAFVfZvgmQ06ucgCGUFPAEBnYIKWiSAtQKJDbnOYpCm58MiC9xf8Sw311vn8Ns-9hGhLuZbLzO8yevcrXLnTT91vEDnl9iUrtalnys.28BMi6sOrg5Zhk6RL9Gc29RtyarJ66gj09SE4fi13eQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=Logitech+Webcams+like+the+C270.%5C&qid=1711118707&sr=8-2).

You can view how the asset is configured

**Play Settings:**

* Play for at least: when detected, the app will play the content corresponding to detection rule for at least X seconds. (Default is 3s)
* Rest for: the device will wait for at least X seconds (Default: 3s) before triggering additional content if multiple rules are detected.

We recommend to keep Play for at least and Rest for at 3s, to give smooth feeling experience when in crowded place like mall, or an airport with many people walking by very quickly.

**Play Rules:**

* Effective Time: This refers to the time frame during which the feature is active and the specific days it applies to.
* If Detected: This describes how the AI camera determines when to trigger a change.
* Play Content: This pertains to the asset assigned to play when a specific gender is detected.

After completing the previous steps, you will be directed to the "Assign to Screen" page. Here, you will assign the AI camera to the specific screen on which you want the camera to trigger.

**That's all!**

Once OptiSigns AI detection is running, you'll notice it's using the camera to detect and send events to the OptiSigns Player to change content as appropriate. In this case, if a male person is in front of the camera, the Suit Sales ad will be displayed. If a female person is in front of the camera, the Yoga ad will be displayed.
