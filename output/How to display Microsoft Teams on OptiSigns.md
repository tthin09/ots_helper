### Why does using Teams require giving OptiSigns Admin permission to use?

OptiSigns uses Microsoft APIs for integration. In order for our integrations to work, the integration has to be approved by an administrator. This is the same across all integrations using Microsoft APIs.

This administrator access is only needed for first time access. Once the OptiSigns app is approved for use, other users can use OptiSigns directly.

### **That's all!**

Congratulation, you have created Microsoft Teams asset, now you can assign it to your screens, playlist, schedule like any other assets.
