# How to install OptiSigns Player on Android Boxes

There are many cost effective Android Boxes or Sticks on the market, such as Xiaomi boxes, sticks, Onn TV box, Mecool, etc.

In general, we recommend using [OptiSigns Android Player](https://links.optisigns.com/szzk) as it's optimized for OptiSigns app performance and stability.

If you're not in the region where OptiSigns Players are available, we recommend Google Chromecast.
