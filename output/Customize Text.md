### Text Styling

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857316627)

Selecting **Bold**, **Italic, Underline, or Strikethrough** will apply those qualities to the selected text. These effects can be stacked on top of each other and used in any combination.

#### Text Case

Selecting **Text Case** will open up a sub-menu:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857321491)

Here you can choose between different letting casings for display:

* **UPPERCASE** - Allows typing exclusively in uppercase.
* **lowercase** - Allows typing exclusively in lowercase.
* **Sentence case** - Automatically formats text to sentence case.
* **Title Case** - Automatically formats text to title case.

#### Alignment

Selecting the **Alignment** option will open up another sub-menu:

Here, choose between **Left, Center, Right,** or **Justified** alignment.

### Link

Selecting the **Link** option lets you turn text into an interactive element, mostly used for kiosks. It will open the **Link Options** section on the Side Menu:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810067603)

Clicking **Add Link** will prompt you to enter a URL or select an asset:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857327251)

Once a link or asset has been chosen, more options will appear in the Link Options section:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810071059)

Expanding the **Scale** section will provide this option for your asset:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810072467)

Here, choose how the image will be scaled. There are three options:

* **Fit (default)** - Fits the image to the screen.
* **Stretch** - Stretches the image to fill the entire screen.
* **Zoom** - Zooms in on the image to fill up the entire screen. Not recommended for small images on large displays, as this will create blurriness.

|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| If a URL is provided, the **Scale** option will not appear. |

Expanding the **Settings** section will provide these options for your link:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810073619)

* **Duration (seconds) -** When the link is clicked or tapped, how long the link or asset will display before returning to the main design. This starts from the last touch on the screen or time the link was clicked.
* **Preload** **-** When checked, the website will load when the design does. This reduces the amount of time it takes for the website to pop up when the link is clicked. However, having numerous links needing to load may cause lag.

Expanding the **Close & Nav Bar Styler** section will provide these options for your link:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857339411)

This section refers to the button that will appear on your screens when it is pushed to them. Clicking or tapping this button will return you back to the original design.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810079379)

* **Icon Position -** Shows where this icon will appear. Defaults toBottom Center, but can be placed anywhere along the top or bottom, or turned off entirely.
* **Icon Style -** Allows you to set the styling of the icon. Choose from Label, Solid, Round, or Default (see above)

### Settings

Selecting the **Settings** button will open the **Data Mapping** section on the Side Menu:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810082323)

Clicking **Make Data Mapping** allows you to make the selected text dynamic, mapped to one of your existing DataSources. See our article on [**Dynamic DataSources with OptiSync**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync)for more information.

### Effects

Selecting the **Effects** option allows you to change a number of different aspects of your text. It will open the **Effects** section on the Side Menu:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857346451)

Here, you have numerous options. We’ll go over each of them in turn.

Expanding the **Color** section allows you to add color to the text.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857353619)

This is functionally the same as the Colors option in the Text Top Menu. Select from preset colors, colors used in this design, or through the [color picker](#ColorPicker).

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857358355)

Expanding the **Background** section allows you to set a specific background color for the Text to sit on.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857363603)

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857365139)

Expanding the **Opacity** section allows you to vary the opacity of the selected area - background and text together.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810101523)

This can be adjusted via slider. Shown below is half opacity:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810111891)

|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| The **Opacity** slider applies to the ***entire selected element*** as opposed to just the text or background. To change the Opacity of the shape or background, do so through the color picker. |

Expanding the **Outline** section allows you add an outline to the text.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857382675)

You can select a color from a dropdown or use hexadecimal HTML, and use the slider to change its thickness:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857388563)

Expanding the **Shadow** section allows you to create a show across your text box. By default, all the sliders will be white.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810125459)

Applying a color will create a shadow:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857392915)

Changing the sliders allows you to change the blur and offset the shadow along the X or Y axis.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857398035)

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810143891)

With no background, the shadow applies only to the text itself:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157857414931)

Expanding the **Gradient** section will present several gradient options for your text. Clicking any of these Gradient options will apply it to your text.

### Lock & Copy Style

Clicking the **Lock** button will lock the selected text element in place, preventing any changes from being made to it.

![firefox_kYoDsUkjzd.gif](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810167443)

This is useful when dealing with many elements after getting the text exactly where you want it.

The **Copy Style** button allows you to quickly apply the style of the selected text element to another.

![firefox_X8Q29qddf2.gif](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42157810168979)
