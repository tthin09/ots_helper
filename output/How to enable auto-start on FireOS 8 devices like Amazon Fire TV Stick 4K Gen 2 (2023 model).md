# How to enable auto-start on FireOS 8 devices like Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Gen 2 (2023 model)

Amazon recently released their new Gen 2 Fire Sticks that come with many changes including to its hardware and OS. While OptiSigns will run great on these new devices, there is an issue where the auto-start feature will not function properly, likely due to the updated version of Fire OS.

In this guide, we will show you how you can properly enable OptiSigns to auto-start on these new Gen 2 Fire Sticks.

Before we begin, please be sure you have the following ready:

* A computer.
* Stable internet connection.
* Ensure that both your computer and your Fire Stick are on the same network.
* Android SDK Platform Tools installed on your computer.\

#### **Step 1:**

On your Fire Stick, navigate to the settings then select “My Fire TV” then click on “Developer Options” and ensure that ABD Debugging is enabled.

\
**Note, in order to enable the developer options, follow these steps:**

1. Go to “Settings” from the home screen of your Fire Stick.\
   \
2. Select the “My Fire TV” or “Device” option.\
   \
3. Click on “About”.\
4. Click on the first option where it labels the model of your Fire TV stick, quickly 7 times. You will see a notification at the bottom saying, "No need, you are already a developer" when this is complete.\
   \
5. Press the back button once or go back to “Settings” > “My Fire TV” and you will now see "Developer Options".

#### **Step 2:**

Exit out of developer options then select “About” then “Network”. You will see the Fire Stick’s network information. In this case, we will want to write down the IP address:

#### **Step 3:**

On your computer, you will need to have the Android SDK Platform Tools installed. You can install this by clicking on the link earlier in this guide. Make sure to create a folder somewhere on your computer such as your desktop then extract the contents on the Android SDK Platform Tools into that folder:

#### **Step 4:**

On your desktop, open the command prompt. On Windows you can do this by typing “cmd” in the search bar on your taskbar. On Mac, it will be called the Terminal.\
\
Once you have this opened, type “cd \”

Type “adb connect <The Firestick IP Address from step 2>”

**NOTE: If you receive a message where it mentions “failed to authenticate to <ip address>” you will need to allow access from your Firestick. Check “always allow from this computer” and press “OK”. Then back on the command prompt, type “adb disconnect” and hit enter.**

Type adb connect <Firestick’s IP address> once more. Once connected, it should look like this:

After you’ve successfully connected, enter this command then hit enter:

```
adb shell pm grant com.optisigns.player android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW
```

This command will now be sent to your Firestick in order to allow OptiSigns to have its auto-start function enabled.

And that’s it! You’re all set!
