# Moderate your social media feeds

If you are using OptiSigns to display your social feed like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, sometimes you want the option to review/approve certain posts before they show up on your screens. This is particularly useful when you use Hashtags as your social feeds, as this gives you a chance to review the content.

OptiSigns has a built-in content moderation feature that allows you to do just that.

#### **Here's how to use it:**

If you haven't created your [Instagram](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016388733), [Facebook](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023848334), or [Twitter](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016375473) wall, you can go ahead and create one.

In Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter app settings, click Advance, and there's an option for Moderation.

By default "Always show new posts" is checked, this means that all new posts will automatically show up on your wall/feed.

You can uncheck, and click on the wheel ![mceclip1.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4403015754515) button to moderate the content.

You then can filter, and search for posts.

And click ![mceclip3.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4403015850387) to hide the post or ![mceclip5.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4403008606995) to delete the post (delete means the post will be deleted from the list in OptiSigns only, not from your account)
