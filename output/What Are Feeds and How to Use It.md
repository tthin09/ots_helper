Each feeds has a recommended duration. This way it helps keep the screen fresh, not repetitive content.

|  |
| --- |
| For example: |
| Safety feeds totaled about 4 minutes, and its recommended duration is 30s. So, that will be 2 slides of the feeds shown when in a playlist. The next time the playlist loops back to the feed, it will continue to the next slides on the feeds, till it finishes the 4 minutes. Afterward, it will then loop back. |

## That's it!
