# How to Clear Cache on a BrightSign Player

### If you're experiencing issues with OptiSigns' applications not performing correctly on your BrightSign player, one of the most common reason is localStorage folder on your SD Card is full.

* BrightSigns does not provide API for apps like OptiSigns to clear or delete the local cache folder.
* So after sometime, the folder can be so big that it consume all storage on the SD card and cause issues.
