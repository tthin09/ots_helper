Fill out:

* Name: name of your Zendesk App, this is only for use in File/Asset list, it will not be displayed on your screen.
* URL: the URL link to the Zendesk dashboard you want to display.
* Update interval: default is 10 minutes. This means the app will refresh the link every 10 mins for any changes in your presentation. If you have a lot of slides, you may want to change this interval to something longer.
