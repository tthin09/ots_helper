# Tutorial: Creating or Updating Website Assets Using GraphQL

Using GraphQL, it is possible to create a website asset on OptiSigns.

| **NOTE** |
| At this time, this Mutation is primarily used to create or update Website assets. |

**1. Creating a New Website Asset**

To do this, we’ll need to create a specific Mutation:

```
mutation saveAsset ($payload: AssetInput!, $teamId: String)\
{saveAsset (payload:$payload,teamId:$teamId){\
  _id\
  originalFileName\
  webLink\
  webType\
  fileType\
  }\
}
```

**Variables:**

```
{\
  "payload": {\
    "originalFileName": "",\
    "webLink": "",\
    "webType": "",\
    "fileType": ""\
  }\
}
```

This Mutation, once run, will create a new asset:

This asset can now be assigned to a device, queried for additional information, or added to a playlist or schedule.

**2. Updating Assets**

Updating assets is as simple as running the same Mutation while providing an \_id field. This can be done for any asset type, not just website assets, but we will be using a website asset as an example.

**Variables:**

```
{\
  "payload": {\
    "_id": "",\
    "originalFileName": "",\
    "webLink": "",\
    "webType": "",\
    "fileType": ""\
  }\
}
```
