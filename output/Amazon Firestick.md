# Amazon Firestick

| As of October 2024, FireStick and Fire TV are **no longer supported** as a digital signage player. This is due to **[Amazon eliminating the ability to auto start the app](https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-blocks-long-running-fire-tv-capability-breaking-popular-apps-with-no-warning-and-giving-developers-the-runaround/)** with FireStick & Fire TVs starting with FireOS 8. Amazon have released their own **[digital signage stick](https://signage.amazon.com/)**, which supports OptiSigns, and we also have our own **[OptiSigns Android Player](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/order-device)**. |

There are workarounds with [ADB commands](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/23274673797139) or manually to start the app.However, those workarounds are very inconvenient. We believe that, without an easy way to AutoStart apps, the Fire Stick is not a good solution for a Digital Signage player.Consider a dedicated player, like our [Android Stick Player](https://links.optisigns.com/szzk), Amazon's [digital signage stick](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/34087061669523-Amazon-Digital-Signage-Stick-Setup), Google ChromeCast, or any [Windows, Mac, or Linux](https://www.optisigns.com/download) device.

* [FireStick Lite](https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite-latest-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G4YP57/) - $29.99 - this one is still running FireOS 7 and still can AutoStart OptiSigns. However, Amazon may roll out OS updates in the future.
  + FireStick Lite has severe issues due to performance, so we do not recommend these even though they technically work.
* **FireOS 8 devices - Not supported:**
  + [Current FireStick 4K](https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k/dp/B0BP9MDCQZ/) - $49.99
  + [Current FireStick 4K Max](https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9/) - $59.99
  + [All new Amazon TVs with FireStick Built-in](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tv+with+amazon+fire+built+in&crid=1U06IFJOW9HS2&sprefix=tv+with+amazon%2Caps%2C99&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_5_14)
* Older FireOS 7 devices - Still can autostart apps
  + [FireStick 4K Gen 1](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Refurbished-streaming-device-controls/dp/B0B8C1HYY8/)
  + Older FireSticks

## **Here are the high-level steps:**

1) Set up Amazon Fire TV Stick

2) Download OptiSigns Digital Signage from Amazon App Store

3) Using OptiSigns' web portal to assign content and remotely manage your screens

So let's dive in!

### **1) Set up Amazon Fire TV Stick**

Plug in FireStick and connect it to power.

When connecting to power, it's temping to use the USB of the TV to power the Fire TV for convenience, but Fire TV consume a lot more power than a TV's USB can supply. So, it is always best to use the power adapter and cable that come with the Fire TV.
