You can set the QR Code to:

* Open any Website URL
* Call a Phone number
* Send an SMS with some prefilled information if needed
* Email address with prefilled subject
* Take users to download your Application for either Apple or Google
* Take users to follow your social media accounts: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
* Share your wifi credentials
* Or just simply a text message that you want to reach your audiences.

**Here’s how you get started to place a QR code on your design with our Designer app.**

Go to  [canvas.optisigns.com](https://canvas.optisigns.com/). Choose your own template from our library of over 1000 free templates or upload your own design. On the left side menu bar, click on 'QR Code,' and then select 'Add QR Code.'

Choose the QR code style for your design, input the necessary information, and click 'Update QR Code' to generate.
