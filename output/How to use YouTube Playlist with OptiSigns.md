* Name: Give your YouTube Playlist a name. This is for displaying in your asset list only. The app will try to get the video's title and use as a name, but you can change it to something else.
* URL: Paste the link to your YouTube playlist here.
* Caption: If the YouTube video has closed caption, the app will show it. Note: closed caption must be created by the YouTube video author, auto generated caption may not work.

Click Save.

After Saving, you can Preview videos to verify.
