# Difference between Instagram & Instagram Business App

|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| To set up an Instagram Business account, we recommend following [this article on Instagram's website](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522). |

As result of Facebook's change in policies, Instagram Consumer and Instagram Business/Creator have different level of access.

**Instagram (or Instagram Consumer):**

* Display posts in your profiles only.

**Instagram Business/Creator:**

* Display post from your profiles
* You can display posts from any public profiles (i.e. <https://www.instagram.com/arsenal>)
* You can also follow and monitor a hashtag
* Get follower counts (for [Instagram Counter App](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047501233))
