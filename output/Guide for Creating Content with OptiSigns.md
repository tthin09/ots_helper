### Displaying Dashboards: Power BI, Reports, and More

### API Integration

At OptiSigns, we strive to build an easy-to-use platform and make even complex use cases user-friendly. With the API gateway and API-to-Screen feature, users can easily integrate their API from other systems, get it mapped using the designer app, then send it to a screen. This requires minimal to no coding and can be set up by users without a software engineering background.

API integration can be applied to many common use cases:

* **Digital menu boards:** Integrate with your point-of-sale systems and get the data management block updated automatically, as well as edit the format of your data management block using the Designer app as needed.
* **Automated HR update:** Use the API from your HR systems to display birthdays or work anniversaries on the screens automatically.
* Any other information display use cases that you will need to consume API data and display the data on the screens.

This feature consists of two parts:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| API Gateway | API-to-Screen Data Mapping with OptiSync |
| This is a console to allows users to centrally manage the APIs, as well as configure and test the APIs. | Use OptiSync's DataSources and Repeaters in the Designer app to get an element on Designer mapped to the API data. The screens will call the API and use the API data on the element when there is a change. |
