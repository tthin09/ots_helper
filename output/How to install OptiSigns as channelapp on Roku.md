| --- |
| Updated Sep 2023: After Roku OS 12.0.0 updates, Roku is more strict with power management and screensaver feature. |

Roku platform has a lot of restrictions. **In short, if you just need to display static menus or simple slideshows, and don't mind spending some time setting it up, then it's OK.**

For better compatibility and reliability, we recommend a dedicated player like our [Android Stick Player,](https://links.optisigns.com/szzk) Google ChromeCast, or any [Windows, Mac, Linux](https://www.optisigns.com/download) devices.
