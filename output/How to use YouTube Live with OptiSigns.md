# How to use YouTube Live with OptiSigns

There are 2 ways to use YouTube Live with OptiSigns.

1) Use a YouTube link that's already live, just like any other YouTube video link, once the live event is over, YouTube will automatically convert it to a normal video link and you still can use it normally.

In this case, you can just copy the YouTube link and use it in our [YouTube app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051014713).

2) You want to schedule a live event.

An example scenario:

A church is broadcasting their Sunday 9AM session on YouTube Live, the church also have overflow rooms in case the main hall is filled, in the overflow rooms, there's already TV, screens for signage & presentation. You can use OptiSigns YouTube Live schedule feature to schedule the live session to go on the TVs in overflow rooms every Sunday 9AM automatically.

In this case, you should use our [YouTube Live Schedule app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060284174)
