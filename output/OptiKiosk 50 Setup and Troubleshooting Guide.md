## Setting Up the OptiKiosk 50

To set up the OptiKiosk 50, you will need these tools:

* Screwdriver (Phillips-head)

### Step 1: Unboxing & Assembly

Once the OptiKiosk is removed from the box, follow the below instructions to get it assembled.

#### **1. Prepare the Kiosk Legs**

* Lay the OptiKiosk 50 on the floor with the screen facing up.
* Locate the mounting screws pre-installed on the bottom of each leg.
* Unscrew these screws temporarily — you will reattach them after inserting the legs into the base.

#### **2. Insert Legs into the Base**

* Position the base so the two slots are facing up.
* Identify the slot with the ethernet cable inside.
* Align the kiosk leg that has a built-in ethernet port with that slot.
* Insert each leg into its respective slot, ensuring proper alignment.

|  |
| --- |
| **TIP** |
| The ethernet cable must be able to reach and connect to the port inside the leg. Ensure the correct leg goes into the correct base slot. |

#### **3. Secure the Legs to the Base**

* Reinsert and tighten the screws to firmly attach the legs to the base.

We recommend doing this step while the kiosk is still lying flat.

#### **4. Connect Internal Cables**

**Ethernet Connection (Leg 1)**

* Inside the leg aligned with the ethernet cable, plug the cable (coming from the base) into the ethernet port inside the leg.

**Power Connections (Leg 2)**

* Two power cables are tucked inside the base and lead into the second leg.
* If the cables are difficult to access, you can:
  + Unscrew the small back panel on the base
  + Pull out the cables
  + Screw the panel back on after connection

**Which Cable Goes Where?**

Inside the leg, there are two power ports side-by-side:

* Top port (closer to the top of the kiosk when upright):\
  Connect the power cable that has a yellow wire.
* Bottom port (closer to the base):\
  Connect the power cable without the yellow wire.

The photo below will help you identify these parts.

**5. Attach the Wheels**

* Flip the base slightly to access the bottom.
* Screw in the 4 caster wheels into the pre-threaded holes.

**6. Power Up the Kiosk**

* Carefully raise the kiosk to a standing position.
* Plug the provided power cord into a wall outlet.
* Locate the power switch on the kiosk and turn it on.

The kiosk will boot up and be ready for use.

### Step 2: Connect to the Internet

Your kiosk must be connected to the internet to display content. You can connect using either of the following methods:

**Method 1: Connect via WiFi Settings**

1. On the Welcome Screen, tap anywhere to open the WiFi setup. Or, open the Settings app → Network & Internet → Internet.
2. Select your WiFi network and enter your password.

**Method 2: Connect using the OptiSigns Admin App**

1. On the Welcome Screen, follow the instructions to download the OptiSigns Admin App.
2. Use the app to configure WiFi on the kiosk.

**Optional: Confirm Your Connection**

* Open the OptiSigns app (pre-installed on the kiosk).
* Swipe right from the left edge of the screen to open the side menu.
* Select Troubleshooting and check the network connection status.

### Step 3: Pair Your Kiosk with OptiSigns

### **Hardware Troubleshooting**

Here, we will cover the most common hardware troubleshooting issues our support team encounters.

#### **Network Troubleshooting**

This is, by far, the most common issue people encounter. Devices experiencing network issues typically appear “Offline” in the OptiSigns portal, even when they are powered on and have content assigned to them.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/46299811073427)

**To identify and resolve network issues:**

* Create a mobile hotspot, then have your OptiKiosk connect with it. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
* Try a different network. You may need to move the device to get connected. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
* If you have firewalls, make sure OptiSigns is whitelisted. Refer to our [Whitelist Article](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047275934) for the required URLs and ports.
* Plug in an Ethernet cable to see if it can still connect.
* After trying to connect with these methods, Factory Reset the device, then perform initial setup again.
* If the device still cannot connect to any network, [contact our support team](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/35626165056787-How-to-Contact-OptiSigns-Support).

#### **Blank Screen Troubleshooting**

If your device and screen are on, but only displays a black screen:

* Network issues, see above.
* Check to make sure there is a Playlist or Asset assigned to your screen.
* Make sure your Timezones and Schedules match, including your Operational Schedule and normal schedule.
* Check your firewall settings, and ensure you’ve [Whitelisted OptiSigns IP addresses and ports](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047275934-Whitelist-OptiSigns-IP-addresses-ports).
* Check your Operational Schedule, and verify its power settings are not set to Off. If an Operational Schedule’s power settings are set to Off, it will remain off during the designed time.

If the device is still not displaying content after you’ve checked these, try a Factory Reset.

#### **App Freezes, Video Assets Not Playing Full Video, or Asset Not Loaded Fully**

To handle any of these issues, hit the Refresh & Relaunch option, then reboot. You may need to Factory Reset if the problem persists.

#### **Performing a Factory Reset**

**Soft Reset**

If your kiosk is still operable, you can perform a soft factory reset directly from the system settings:

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Scroll down and select System.
3. Tap Reset options.
4. Choose Erase all data (factory reset).
5. Confirm your choice to begin the reset.

This will erase all data from the kiosk’s internal storage, including Google accounts, system and app data, downloaded apps, music, photos, and any other user content. After the reset is complete, the device will restart with its original factory settings.
