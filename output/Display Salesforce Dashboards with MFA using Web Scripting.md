#### Displaying Salesforce Dashboards on your digital screens is crucial to getting real-time data directly to who needs it. Let's go through how to set up your MFA-protected Salesforce Dashboard by using our Web Scripting app!

Things You'll Need:

* [Salesforce Dashboard](https://www.salesforce.com/)
* [Burp Suite Navigation Recorder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/burp-suite-navigation-rec/anpapjclbjicacakeoggghfldppbkepg)

## Setting Up MFA

|  |
| --- |
| *If you don't already have MFA set up for your Salesforce account, please visit their support article: **[Multi-Factor Authentication for Salesforce Orgs.](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_overview_2fa.htm&type=5)*** |

Next, go to your account settings > My Personal Information > Advanced User Details

From there, click **"Connect"** on "**App Registration: One-Time Password Authenticator**"

When Salesforce prompts you to connect an Authenticator App, **DO NOT** immediately scan the QR code.

Click "**I Can't Scan the QR Code**".

![Salesforce setting up authenticator app. Select 'I can't scan the QR code'](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/35528807336979)

**Copy and paste the alphanumeric string** displayed underneath "Key". **Save this key** somewhere secure, like the Notepad app.

* This is ***necessary*** for the web scripting process later.

Next, enter that setup key in your authenticator app, then enter the verification code into Salesforce, and connect!
