## Common Issues

Canva is an excellent resource for graphics, marketing, and designs. While using it, users should be aware of certain specific features:

* While Canva is great for general design, our Kiosk Designer tool is specifically optimized for digital signage, ensuring perfect resolution, local content caching, and seamless navigation. This specialization makes our tool the superior choice for reliable and high-quality digital signage displays.
* If you, as a user, lack the necessary access rights to a design, you may encounter an error message stating, "**You don't have permission to see this design**." Please verify that you are logged into the correct account or request access from the design's creator, and ensure the account is set to public.
