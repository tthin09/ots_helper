## Setting Up an OptiDev App from OptiSigns

There are two ways to set up an OptiDev app on OptiSigns.

The first is directly through OptiDev itself. See their article on [**Publishing to OptiSigns**](https://docs.optidev.ai/features/publish-to-optisigns) for more on that.

The other is via the OptiDev app. That is what we’ll be covering below.

To get started, go to **Assets → Add Asset → Apps**.

Find **OptiDev** on the list of apps:

This will open up the **OptiDev Configuration** window.

There are essentially four elements to this screen:

* **Name** - Give your OptiDev asset a name. This is strictly for use in OptiSigns.
* **OptiDev Published URL** - The URL of your Published OptiDev project. We will explain how to obtain this in a moment.
* **Preview Window** - This shows how your OptiDev asset will look when pushed to a screen.
* **Orientation Options** - Change between Landscape and Portrait orientation for the Preview

First, give your asset a name. Then you’ll need to get the Published URL.

To do this, go to your OptiDev project, then Publish it. You can publish it either Publicly or Privately. Then, click the Live Site link.

Copy the URL from the web address bar:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/47616485602707)

Paste the link into the OptiDev Published URL field:

|  |
| --- |
| **IMPORTANT** |
| OptiDev and OptiSigns are linked through your browser. To ensure your Published Link displays properly, please stay logged in to both OptiDev and OptiSigns through this process. These can be in different tabs. |

Now your OptiDev asset should display in the Preview:

Make any changes and adjustments needed via the Orientation tab, then hit **Save.**

Congratulations! You’ve successfully created an OptiDev asset.

## Security Features

OptiSigns and OptiDev share security frameworks, meaning it is possible to publish OptiDev projects to OptiSigns without ever making the project public. To use this feature, you will need a Standard subscription on the OptiDev platform.
