# How to Change the Account Owner

Account Owner is a special role. Only Account Owners can request deletion of accounts.\
There's only 1 Owner per account.

You can change owner to another user/admin in OptiSigns by:

* Go to the [Account Member](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/account-members) page:
* Click the **Change Role** icon on the user or admin that you want to change to Owner.

## How to Transfer Account Ownership if Owner Has Left the Organization

In some cases, the person who owns the account may leave the organization they are managing OptiSigns for, suddenly or otherwise. In this case, it is necessary for someone else to assume account ownership.

To do this, an authorized representative will need to fill out [this form](https://20629229.cdnp1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20629229/conversations_hidden_files/Sensitive%20Files/Confirmation%20of%20Account%20Transfer.pdf?Expires=1753808004&Signature=dh-OAHUQySs6DB140YOdG69OCCd9xAjrbSKs28dQaAKfzYFAEP-1FR5I4fMXudpVRUL2VsfyD5LUGRhQgMJr8B5XzBkTQGTN5xf28Apm6uA6~gDP-giokrdYstuVyiedrJKk9F0P8RSyRBWLCs-QmUlpJ18pGkXYy80jDEuuOJU0heVNrjT5Gd81454UxGniB2of82K8djchNvyxxhXqMyvnmMqU-fMA5CKD16dp7unkLcBLEz3A5yGh6u8kHgYYGjEZJOyRXigwQETmoFVtfSGY~B5E6KS-MC7lmRYpVS2bqdiWbCa1hpW5CKl7Pf9enioOllyOw7ECLjn7rA3xhQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJDNICOKANPHVCSBQ) and submit it to [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns).
