## Setting Up the OptiKiosk 32

To set up the OptiKiosk 32, you will need these tools:

* Screwdriver (Phillips-head)
* VESA-compatible mount (for wall-mount version)

The below steps will apply to the stand model only. If you purchased the wall-mount version, please use a VESA-compatible mount (not included) to install your kiosk securely.

### **Step 1: Unboxing & Assembly** (Stand Model)

| --- |
| **TIP** |
| Two people are recommended for lifting and mounting the display safely. |

1. Place the bottom half of the vertical pole into the slot on the base. Thread the power cord through the center opening and connect it to the charging port. Snap the cover back on. Secure the pole by fastening the four screws into the bottom of the base (tighten diagonally for best stability.\
   \
   ![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/44669736130451)
2. Align the upper half of the pole with the base section. Insert and tighten the provided screw to lock both sections together.\
   \
   ![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/44669736133395)
3. Ensure the mounting bracket is in a horizontal position (the two slotted holes should face upward). With two people, lift the screen in a horizontal position and align it with the VESA mounting holes. Slide the screen down so the top screws lock into place.\
   \

4. Tighten all four screws on the mounting bracket to secure the screen. Connect the power cord from the stand to the kiosk charging port. Snap the magnetic back cover over the bracket to hide the cables.\

5. Attach the power cord to the adapter. Plug the cord into the base of the kiosk, then connect the adapter to a standard power outlet.
6. Press and hold the power button (⏻) on the back of the device for 2–3 seconds to turn on.

**To power off:**

* Press and hold ⏻ for 2–3 to open the shutdown menu.

Short press ⏻ to put the screen in standby mode (press again to wake).

### Step 2: Connect to the Internet

Your kiosk must be connected to the internet to display content.

Connect using either of the following methods:

**Method 1: Connect via WiFi Settings**

1. On the Welcome Screen, tap anywhere to open the WiFi setup. Or, open the **Settings app** → **Network & Internet** → **Internet**.
2. Select your WiFi network and enter your password.

### **Hardware Troubleshooting**

Here, we will cover the most common hardware troubleshooting issues our support team encounters.

#### **Network Troubleshooting**

This is, by far, the most common issue people encounter. Devices experiencing network issues typically appear “Offline” in the OptiSigns portal, even when they are powered on and have content assigned to them.

![device offline optisigns portal](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/44668998129427)

**To identify and resolve network issues:**

* Create a mobile hotspot, then have your OptiKiosk connect with it. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
* Try a different network. You may need to move the device to get connected. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
* If you have firewalls, make sure OptiSigns is whitelisted. Refer to our [Whitelist Article](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047275934) for the required URLs and ports.
* Plug in an Ethernet cable to see if it can still connect.
* After trying to connect with these methods, Factory Reset the device, then perform initial setup again.
* If the device still cannot connect to any network, [contact our support team](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/35626165056787-How-to-Contact-OptiSigns-Support).

#### **Blank Screen Troubleshooting**

If your device and screen are on, but only displays a black screen:

* Network issues, see above.
* Check to make sure there is a Playlist or Asset assigned to your screen.
* Make sure your Timezones and Schedules match, including your Operational Schedule and normal schedule.
* Check your firewall settings, and ensure you’ve [Whitelisted OptiSigns IP addresses and ports](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047275934-Whitelist-OptiSigns-IP-addresses-ports).
* Check your Operational Schedule, and verify its power settings are not set to Off. If an Operational Schedule’s power settings are set to Off, it will remain off during the designed time.

If the device is still not displaying content after you’ve checked these, try a Factory Reset.\

#### **App Freezes, Video Assets Not Playing Full Video, or Asset Not Loaded Fully**

To handle any of these issues, hit the Refresh & Relaunch option, then reboot. You may need to Factory Reset if the problem persists.

#### **Factory Reset**

**Soft Reset**

If your kiosk is still operable, you can perform a soft factory reset directly from the system settings:

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Scroll down and select System.
3. Tap Reset options.
4. Choose Erase all data (factory reset).
5. Confirm your choice to begin the reset.

This will erase all data from the kiosk’s internal storage, including Google accounts, system and app data, downloaded apps, music, photos, and any other user content. After the reset is complete, the device will restart with its original factory settings.

**Hard Reset**

If your device is inoperable, you may need to perform a hard factory reset and restore the OptiKiosk 32 to its original factory settings. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Locate the reset button
   * While the kiosk is powered on, find the pinhole reset button on the back of the device, positioned between the two USB ports.
2. Press and hold
   * Use a small tool such as a SIM card ejector pin, paperclip, or similar object.
   * Press and hold the reset button until the kiosk screen reboots, then release.
3. Enter recovery mode
   * Once in recovery mode, use the volume buttons on the back of the device to navigate the menu.
   * Press the “–” (minus) button until you highlight “Wipe data / factory reset.”
4. Confirm the reset
   * Press the power button (located next to the volume buttons) to select.
   * Confirm your choice when prompted to begin the factory reset.
5. Complete the process
   * Once the reset is finished, select “Reboot system now.”
   * The kiosk will restart with factory settings restored.

#### **Power and Battery Recovery**

The OptiKiosk 32 with the optional rechargeable battery can operate either while plugged into power or on battery alone. The included power adapter powers the device and charges the battery simultaneously.

**Important Note:**

If the kiosk is running on battery and the battery drains completely, the device will power off. After this happens, the kiosk will not turn back on immediately when plugged back into the power adapter. Instead, it needs approximately 20 minutes of charging time before it will restart. This behavior is normal and protects the battery.

**Best Practices:**

Whenever possible, plug the kiosk into power if you expect extended use. If using the battery, plan for up to 8 hours of runtime on a full charge. Avoid letting the battery drain completely to reduce downtime. If the device shuts down from a depleted battery, simply connect the adapter and allow it to charge for 20 minutes before powering it back on.
