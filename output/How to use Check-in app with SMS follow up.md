Due to SMS regulation, very limited changes, and customization can be done to the SMS message. The message content has to remain pretty much constant, the only thing that can be changed is the company name.

By default, the customer will receive an SMS message **4 hours** after check-in asking about their experience and write a review for you on Google.
