### Are there file size limitations?

Yes. They depend on hardware and various other factors.

The individual file upload limit is 1 GB by default. This limitation can be lifted if necessary by contacting our support team at [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com).

For playlists, this is capped at 2 GB, which can be further throttled by device storage. This is another reason we recommend our OptiSigns devices, as storage becomes less of an issue.
