# Changing screen's orientation (portrait & landscape)

OptiSigns support rotation of your screens:

* Landscape (0 Degree)
* Rotate 90 Degrees
* Rotate 180 Degrees
* Rotate 270 Degrees

Of course, for best display experience, please ensure you have content that would fit the portrait modes. Our apps are designed to fit portrait mode as well.

You can do so by update the screen's setting on the portal (<https://app.optisigns.com/>):
