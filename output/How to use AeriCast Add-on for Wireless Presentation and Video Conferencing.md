# How to use AeriCast Add-on for Wireless Presentation and Video Conferencing

With the AeriCast add-on, you can turn any conference room TV into a digital sign. Aericast also allows user to present from their laptops to those screens without needing cables, dongles or extra hardware.

With a USB webcam, mic and speakers connected to the OptiSigns Windows Player, users can wirelessly link these devices and use them in the video conference.

It's done in three easy steps:

1. Create AeriCast Wireless Presentation app in your "Files/Assets"
2. Assign it to your screen
3. Wirelessly mirror your screen from a [laptop](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/14502378549907) or [iOS/Android phone, tablet](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/14557706459283), or begin [AeriCast Add-on wireless conferencing](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/23030445716883/)

The app can also be placed at the bottom strip of a [Split Screen](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573). This allows the rest of your screen to be used as a sign when not in use:

## **Setting Up the Aericast Add-On:**

* **Name:** Name of your AeriCast Wireless Presentation app, this is the name of the app in your asset list. It will not be displayed on your screens.
* **Title:** Enter a title to be displayed on your screen. For example: "Welcome to Conf. Room N123"
* **Message:** Enter a message to be displayed on your screen. This could be anything: a fun workplace meme, a reminder message, or instructions on how to use the room.
* **Expires in:** The 4 digit presenter codes are set to expire every 10 minutes by default. This is to prevent someone saving the code and using it days or weeks later.
* **Background Playlist:** By default, the app plays a few images in the background. This is for aesthetics, and also to prevent your screen from developing stuck pixels. You can customize what images play here with a Playlist. Note: only images will be played.
* **Background Opacity:** This appears only when a Playlist is selected and allows the user to change the opacity of the background so that the text still stands out effectively.
* **Text Color:** Default is white, but if you'd like another color, this option provides them.
* **Different Presenter Code for each screens**: When you assign any device, the pairing code will be different on different devices.
