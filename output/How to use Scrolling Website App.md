* Name: name of your Scrolling Website App, this is only for use in File/Asset list, it will not be displayed on your screen.
* URL: the URL link to the page you want to display.
* Request Desktop Site: if you are using Amazon Fire Stick or Android as your player, if this box is checked, the app will try to request desktop version of the web page.
* Scroll Type: You can select
  + - * Down & Up: the app will scroll the web page down, and then scroll up.
      * Scroll to: the app will jump to a certain location on the web page
