# How to Use the Weather Alert App

### In this article, we walk you through setting up a Weather Alert App to subscribe to weather alerts from the [**National Weather** **Service**](https://www.weather.gov/).

With the OptiSigns Weather Alert App, you can select a region to receive weather alerts from. The app will listen to the ATOM feed published by the National Weather Service and display any incoming notices. Filters can be applied for certain types of messages and target locations.\

This app can be placed in the main screen zone or as a ticker, and it will adjust automatically and fit your screen. Default content can also be set so that when there is no weather alert, this will not be displayed.

The Weather Alert App is available to **Standard**plan subscribers and above.
