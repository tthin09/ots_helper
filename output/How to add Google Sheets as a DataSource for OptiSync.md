## Adding Your Google Sheets as a DataSource

There are two different methods to adding Google Sheets to your DataSources:

#### **Method 1: Through Designer**

* On the Files/Assets page, select **Designer** from the Apps
* Select **DataSource** on the side menu, then **Add DataSource**
* Click **Google Sheets**
* Copy and Paste your Google Sheets URL into the provided text box, then **Import Data**
  + Note: You will be prompted to sign into your Google
* Once your Google Sheets is imported into a table in our portal, click **Save**
* **Name** your DataSource something easily recognizable
* Select your Synchronization and Update Interval
* Click **Done**

**Method 2: Through Account Settings**

* In our portal, select your account name, then **More**, then **DataSources**
* Select **Google Sheets**from the list of options
* Copy and Paste your Google Sheets URL into the provided text box, then **Import Data**
  + Note: You will be prompted to sign into your Google
* Once your Google Sheets is imported into a table in our portal, click **Update**
* **Name** your DataSource something easily recognizable
* Select your Synchronization and Update Interval
* Click **Done**
* Your **DataSource** will now be listed within your Advanced Account Settings

**Synchronization**

* **Only import once:** This option imports the data only once when you add the DataSource. After the initial import, the data will not be updated automatically.
* **Periodic direct access:** This option regularly fetches the latest data directly from the device through your gateway, providing "live access" to the data and ensuring you have the most up-to-date information available directly from the device.
  + *This is better for more consistent update intervals, but could cause performance issues.*
* **Periodic background sync:** This option periodically syncs data to your server in the background at regular intervals, reducing the need for direct queries to the device.

| **IMPORTANT** |
| OptiSync does not support special characters (i.e. anything outside the scope of an English-language keyboard). This will cause the system data to read as blank, and it will not show. |

**Update Interval**

*The duration of time between updates if you chose "Periodic direct access" or "Periodic background sync"*

* None *(Your Datasource will import with the newest data available, but will not continuously update afterward. You will have to force refresh data for new updates.)*
* 30 minutes
* 1 hour
* 8 hours
