# PowerPoint Resolution, Size for use with Digital Signage

One of the common question we got is what's the optimal page size, resolution for PowerPoint slides to use on big screens TVs.

The simple answer is:

* For HD TV: resolution is 1920 x 1080 pixels, it's equivalent of 20in x 11.25in
* For 4K TV: resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels, it's equivalent of 40in x 22.5in
* For 8K TV resolution is 7680 × 4320 pixels, it's equivalent of 80in x 45in

There are 3 components to the answer, and read more to see how to set this up in PowerPoint.

1. Aspect Ratio
2. Orientation
3. Size or Resolution

So let's talk about each one.

## **1) Aspect Ratio**

Aspect ratio is important, because not having the correct aspect ratio will result in your presentation have "black bars" on top, bottom or left and right of the screen; or you have to stretch the document, which result in a bit of distortion of text, images.

If you are putting the PowerPoint Presentation on to big screen TVs, they are all 16:9 aspect ratio. Newer version of PowerPoint automatically set the correct aspect ratio to "Widescreen" 16:9.

In case you need to change yours. Click Design -> Screen Size and select wide screen like below.

## **2) Orientation**

PowerPoint document by default has landscape orientation. If you need portrait orientation. Just go to Design -> Slide Size and flip the Slide Orientation from Landscape to Portrait.

PowerPoint will flip the orientation and keep your aspect ratio.

## **3) Size or Resolution**

* For HD TV: resolution is 1920 x 1080 pixels, it's equivalent of 20in x 11.25in
* For 4K TV: resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels, it's equivalent of 40in x 22.5in
* For 8K TV resolution is 7680 × 4320 pixels, it's equivalent of 80in x 45in

If you have different screen resolution, resolution, you can use [this calculator](https://www.unitconverters.net/typography/inch-to-pixel-x.htm).

You may ask: "But wait, my 4K TV is 65', why set resolution to 40in x 22.5in?"

Yes in theory, you can calculate 65' diagonal = 56.65' × 31.87', but your resolution is still 4K, it will not display higher resolution better, and making bigger media files will make it slower to load and have to scale back to 4K resolution.
