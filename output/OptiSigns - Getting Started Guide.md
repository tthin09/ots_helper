#### Pick one of the 3 ways below to get OptiSigns running on your TV:

1. The easiest way to get started is to get your favorite brand of TV and get our[**OptiSigns OptiStick**](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-android-stick-player-2) to run OptiSigns on it. Follow [**this guide**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/27267311796243) to learn how to set up your OptiSigns Player
2. Already have a TV or Signage Player? Go to our[**Downloads**](https://www.optisigns.com/download) page to see if our app can be installed on it.
3. Not ready for hardware purchase yet? Just download the [**Windows Player app**](https://links.optisigns.com/win) or [**MacOS Player app**](https://links.optisigns.com/mac) and use your laptop as test screen.

Once OptiSigns App is installed, **launch it**.

The app will ask if you want to automatically start when the device starts up.

Then, you will see this **pairing screen:**
