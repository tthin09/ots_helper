# How to Use QR Overlay App in Engage

With OptiSigns’s QR Overlay, you can create custom QR codes that overlay your content, allowing you to easily share links, videos, contacts, and much more.

As the content displays, the QR will stay on top at the location you place it in.

This is Free for all users on all plans.

# **Let's jump in and get started:**

First, head over to our Engage section in our OptiSigns portal, or click on the link below:

* Corners Square: These are the squares in the corner. Change the visual style, the color type, and the color of the dots.
* Error Correction Level: The error correction level in a QR code (L, M, Q, H) determines its ability to withstand damage while remaining readable:
  + - L (Low): Provides basic error correction and can recover up to 7% of damaged data.
    - M (Medium): Offers a moderate level of error correction, capable of recovering up to 15% of damaged data.
    - Q (Quartile): Provides a high level of error correction, allowing recovery of up to 25% of damaged data.
    - H (High): Offers the highest level of error correction, capable of recovering up to 30% of damaged data.

Now, assign the playback content type.

This could be an asset, playlist, or schedule within your account that you’d like to be the standard content shown.

You can also adjust the scaling of the asset to

* Fit
* Stretch
* Zoom your display.
