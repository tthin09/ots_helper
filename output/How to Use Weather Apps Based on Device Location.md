# How to Use Weather Apps Based on Device Location

If you have many screens in different locations, and you want to display local weather, you can just make 1 weather app, and set it to use device's location instead of having to make many weather apps.

First set your device's location.

In Edit screen, click Advanced, and add location.

You can also edit location of multiple screens at the same time by selecting them and click Edit

Next, in your weather app select the option to "Use Device Setting's Location".

You still need to set the default location, this location will be used in case device does not have location set up.
