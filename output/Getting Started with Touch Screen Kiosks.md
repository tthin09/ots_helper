### Kiosk Lite

Kiosk Lite is a quick and easy interactive solution for your kiosk. You can showcase an asset or playlist as ads. Then, when the kiosk encounters a simple interaction, it smoothly transitions to display your website URL.

| **Use Case** |
| If you have a pre-built asset, such as a playlist, image, or video, that you want to use as an attract screen and then direct users to your website upon interaction, Kiosk Lite is the easiest method to get your kiosk up and running quickly. It's designed for easy use and quick setup, allowing you to get your kiosk running in minutes with engaging content that captures attention and drives user interaction. |

## Getting Your Kiosk Design onto a Touchscreen

There are three ways of getting your Kiosk design onto a Touchscreen:

1. Through Engage
2. Through Designer (if using Kiosk Designer Pro)
3. Manually Pushing it to a Screen

Note that you'll almost certainly want to enable **[Lock Down mode](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/30310366838803-Enabling-Lock-Down-Mode-on-Touch-Screen-Devices#windows)**to prevent users from interfering with any OptiSigns settings on your device.

### Option 1: Through Engage

This option will be chosen if you click **"Assign"** after setting up your Kiosk design in Kiosk Lite or Content Library Kiosk.

![firefox_3tMGmCJBio.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/31449641337491)

![firefox_HT8qICiYip.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/31449641342099)

Once you've created the parameters for your kiosk, you can assign it directly to one of your screens. There are two options:

* **Target -** Select between Screens and Tags. Selecting one or the other will change the next option to either Screens or Tags, depending on which you select here.
* **Screens / Tags** - Select which screen or tag where you want your content to appear.

Once you've made your selections, click **Assign** to proceed. If you prefer to wait, choosing **Assign Later** allows you to assign your content at any time through the other options.

---

### Option 2: Through Designer

|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE:** This applies to kiosk designs created through **Kiosk Designer Pro** |

To push screens using the Designer app, start by creating your kiosk design. Follow our [Kiosk Designer Pro guide](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/15313086319763-How-to-Design-Kiosk-Apps-Using-Kiosk-Designer-Pro) for step-by-step instructions.

Once you've created your kiosk design, rename it and hit **Save**. Once the asset is saved, the **Push to Screens** option will become available:

![push to screen designer](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43045937814931)

Clicking it will open this window:

![firefox_tPQdxC4U7a.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/31696267664915)

* **Asset** - The name of your asset.
* **Scale** - Choose between None, Fit, Stretch, and Zoom. Fit is the default. This shows how the image will be displayed on your screen.
* **Target -** Here, select between Screens, Tags, and Tag Rules. To better understand Tags and Tag Rules, read [this article.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/20879903340947-How-to-Use-Content-Tags-in-The-Playlist)
* **Screens / Tags / Tag Rule** - Select which screen, tag, or tag rule will be associated with the QR code. This determines where your content will appear.

Once these are input, you have a few other options:

* **Temp Takeover** - Allows the QR code to temporarily take over the selected screen. You can select from several predetermined time frames, or create your own.
* **Schedule Changes** - Allows you to schedule when the QR code goes live and appears on screen.
* **Push** - Immediately push your QR code to the screen, for an indeterminate amount of time.

You'll also be able to Preview your screen before you push it live. Once you do, you're done!

### Option 3: Directly Assigning Content to a Screen

This option will be necessary should you choose **"Save"** or **"Assign Later"** after setting up the kiosk design, and can be done with any type of kiosk design.

![firefox_b2lsu0KfQ6.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/31449657938323)

If you want to push your kiosk design to a screen, you'll need to find it under the **Engage** tab. Hover over it and you should see three dots. Click on this, and you'll see the **"Push to Screens"** option.![firefox_8U32WAaexO.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/31449657942419)Once there, you'll see these options:![dnqFMu0Ry0.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/31449641356051)

* **Asset** - The name of your asset.
* **Target -** Here, select between Screens, Tags, and Tag Rules. To better understand Tags and Tag Rules, read [this article.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/20879903340947-How-to-Use-Content-Tags-in-The-Playlist)
* **Screens / Tags / Tag Rule** - Select which screen, tag, or tag rule will be associated with the Kiosk. This determines where your content will appear.

Once these are input, you have a few other options:

* **Temp Takeover** - Allows the Kiosk interface to temporarily take over the selected screen. You can select from several predetermined time frames, or create your own.
* **Schedule Changes** - Allows you to schedule when the kiosk interface goes live and appears onscreen.
* **Push** - Immediately push your kiosk interface to the screen, for an indeterminate amount of time.

You'll also be able to Preview your screen before you push it live.

## FAQs

Below are some of the most common questions we get surrounding getting a kiosk set up.

### How can I lock down my kiosk on a Windows device?

Windows itself offers a built-in [Kiosk Mode (Assigned Access)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/assigned-access/), which can restrict a user account to run only a single app—such as OptiSigns. This prevents users from exiting the app or accessing the desktop.\
\

This approach works well for locking down the device. 

|  |
| --- |
| **IMPORTANT** |
| For Assigned Access, only Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the Microsoft store will appear. OptiSigns is a Win32 app, meaning it will not be available in the Assigned Access list.   You can use Shell Launcher to replace the user interface from the Windows shell (explorer.exe) to OptiSigns. Keep in mind that this is only available on Windows 10/11 Enterprise, Education, or IoT Enterprise. Shell Launcher is not available on Home or Pro editions.   You can always keep keyboard shortcuts available if no keyboard is needed for the kiosk. |

Consider using Windows Group Policy or third-party tools to further restrict keyboard shortcuts, Task Manager access, or other escape routes.
