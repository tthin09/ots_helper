To achieve the screen layout like above, we first [create a Split Screen layout](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).\
Then create Scrolling Strip to assign to the bottom or top part of the split screen.

To create a Scrolling Strip, first click Files/Assets -> Apps -> Scrolling Strip

Enter a name, this name will be use in your Asset list.\
Next select Type. It can be Weather, News, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter feeds etc.

You then can assign the scrolling strip to your split screen zone.\
For your convenient, if you use one of our Split Screen Templates, we already label Zone name with "Scrolling Strip" and you just need to assign the newly create Scrolling Strip there.
