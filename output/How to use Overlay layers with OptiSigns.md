# How to use Overlay layers with OptiSigns

With OptiSigns SplitScreen, you can overlay items on top of each other.\
In example below we overlay OptiSigns Logo and a QR Code on top of the screen.\
As the content play, the logo keep staying on top.\
This is particular useful if you want to overlay logo, QR Codes, but you can overlay any content.
