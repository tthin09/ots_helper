The new [Amazon Signage Stick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4FCG9MX/ref=pmkt_cms105_web) is out, and it supports OptiSigns. We’ll help you get our app up and running on it in no time.

## Setting Up the Amazon Signage Stick

First, plug the Amazon Signage Stick into the HDMI port on your screen, then connect it to a power source.

Power it on, then follow the onscreen instructions to set up your Network access.

Once the signage player is online, you should see a screen similar to the one below urging you to pair your device.

If you’d like to change your device name, hit the **Edit** button.

Your DSN is fixed, but you can edit the name of the device.

Now that you’ve assigned OptiSigns to your device, the app will launch. Once it does, you’ll need to pair it with the OptiSigns portal, which is where you’ll assign content to display on your screen.
