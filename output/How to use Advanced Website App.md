  + - * Down & Up: the app will scroll the web page down, and then scroll up.
      * Scroll to: the app will jump to a certain location on the web page
* Speed: how fast you want to scroll, you can also customize the speed.
* Page Height: enter the number in Pixel. This is needed because the app does not know how long a web page is, also some web page like social media has infinite scrolling.
* Zoom: depend on what kind of your website's content, zoom may help the content to be displayed better on your screens.
* Update interval: default is 10 minutes. This means the app will refresh the link every 10 mins for any changes of your website.

* Preload: if you want to show your Advanced Website App to user instantly (when you put it in a playlist), you can set preload value (by seconds), the app will preload the URL in the background.
