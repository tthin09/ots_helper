# How to install OptiSigns Player on Apple TV

Apple TV is one of the most cost efficient ways to get your digital signs going if you're just starting.

Before we get going, a few limitations you should take note.

* Apple does not recommend using Apple TV to play website, so some websites may not display properly or Apple may remove support for displaying website. We do not have control over Apple's roadmap.
* More than 3-4 zones with heavy websites (like PowerBI dashboard) may result in crashing or freezing.
