* **Name**: Give your YouTube video a name. This is for displaying in your asset list only. The app will try to get the video's title and use as name, but you can change it to something else.
* **URL**: Paste the link to your YouTube video here. This should be the actual URL, not the Share link:

| **NOTE** |
| For Youtube Shorts, change the part of the URL that reads **/shorts****/**to instead read **/embed/**.  Example:  <https://youtube.com/shorts/BUXczOFByAU?si=TO8RGfmokQMdsI6R>  becomes  [https://youtube.com/embed/BUXczOFByAU?si=TO8RGfmokQMdsI6R](https://youtube.com/embed/BUXczOFByAU?si=TO8RGfmokQMdsI6R "https://youtube.com/embed/BUXczOFByAU?si=TO8RGfmokQMdsI6R")  This will allow Youtube Shorts to display in OptiSigns. |

* **Caption**: If the YouTube video has closed caption, the app will show it. Note: closed caption must be created by the YouTube video author, auto generated caption may not work.

Click Save.\
After Saving, you can Preview the video to verify.\
