**Limitations:**

* Only image and video files are supported. If there are other files in the folder, they will be ignored.
  + For images, only JPEG and PNG files are supported.
* Be sure the names of your files do not have any common forbidden characters in your file names, e.g. '/', else the Drive may not load.
* To ensure good performance of the app, max file size is limit at 100MB, and max number of files supported in folder is 200. If you have big video files, it's better to upload directly to OptiSigns; and if you have more than 200 files, you can split them up in multiple Google Drive folders.
