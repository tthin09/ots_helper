* Name: Name of your Motivational Quote app that you wish to see it labeled as within the OptiSigns platform. This name is internal to you only.

  + Playlist - This allows you to select an playlist of images that you want to appear as backgrounds to the quotes provided. Background Opacity and Text Color also become enabled.
  + Single Color - This allows you to select a single color background based on the default themes provided through OptiSigns.

* Text Color:  This appears only when a Playlist is selected and allows user to enter the hex-code for the text color

* Quote:  Free-form text field to allow you to enter the quote and the author of the quote. Additional quotes can be added using the "+ New Quote" button
