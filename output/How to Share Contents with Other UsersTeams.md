# How to Share Contents with Other Users/Teams

#### Teams are designed for the separation of resources to maintain structured and secure workflows. Despite the separation, cross-teaming resource sharing is supported using folder security features. With OptiSigns, you can use folder security features in the folder and share the folder with different teams.

| **Note:** This feature is only available in the Pro Plan or above. |

**Use Case:** You want to share global or specific regional folders with users/teams. Set up the permission in the folder. A Shared Folder gives OptiSigns Account Admins/Owners the ability to share content with different users/teams. Shared Folder works on any feature in OptiSigns, including Screens, Files/Assets, Playlists, or Schedule Tabs.

2. Once a folder is created, hover over it and click on **3 vertical dots**. You will have to click on "**Change Permission**", this allow you to give certain users or team to view this folder globally as long as they are given access.
