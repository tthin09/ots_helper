# How to Create and Use the Split Screen App

The Split Screen feature in OptiSigns allows you to divide your screen into different zones or regions, enabling a more dynamic display of content. This feature is supported on all platforms except Roku and Apple TV. Commonly referred to as Split Screens, Screen Zones, or Screen Layouts, this guide will walk you through the steps to create and use the split screen app.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/30984941345555)

1. **Name Your Split Screen**: Enter a name for your Split Screen. This name will appear in the Asset list.
2. **Adjust Orientation:** Change the split screen to landscape or portrait orientation.
3. **Name the Zone:** Not required to change, but you can give each zone a name.
4. **Adjust Zone Dimensions**: Modify the position and dimensions of the zones if needed.
   1. The numbers are in percentages to ensure the layout scales appropriately regardless of screen resolution.
   2. Or, you can click on a zone, and drag and drop the edges to change the zone's size.
5. **Assign Content to Zones**: For each zone, select the type of content you want it to play (asset, playlist, or schedule).
6. **Add or Adjust the Zones:** Use the options on this bar to change the colored zones.
   * **Plus Icon:** Will add another zone.
   * **Undo and Redo:** Either reverse an action or reapply an action you undid.
   * **Adjust Layering of Zones:** Send zones backward, to the back, forward, or to the front. These are useful if your zones overlap each other.
   * **Delete:** Select a zone and delete it from the customization board.

* **Scrolling Strip Integration**: Split Screen can be accompanied by a Scrolling Strip. Apps like Weather, News, Social Media walls, and Stock automatically switch to a scrolling strip format when placed in a scrolling strip-like zone.

| You can assign a Split Screen directly to a playlist, but it can create a loop (a Split Screen containing a playlist that contains a Split Screen). Instead, we recommend assigning a playlist to the zones within the Split Screen. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### **I can't get some of my split screens to display as full screen. What can I do?**

This issue occurs because the **Main Zone** in the Split Screen app does not have a 16:9 ratio. Here are a few ways to resolve this and ensure the content fits your Main Zone:

1. **Resize the Designer Asset:**

   * Ensure your asset size matches that of the **Main Zone,**\
   * For example: in the below screenshot, the Main Zone is 1920x970. So you'll want to resize your Designer asset to match that number.![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/37700048880275)\
2. **Adjust the Main Zone Ratio:**

   * Change the Main Zone size to **1920x1080**, and use other zones as an overlay.\
   * This works best with scrolling strips![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/37700029022099)\
3. **Use the Stretch Option:**

   * In the playlist settings, set the **Scale Image** option to **Stretch**.
   * This will stretch the content to fill the Main Zone.![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/37700048887059)

You can get an idea of what these settings will look like with this image:

For more information on image ratios, see our article on [**Stretch, Zoom, and Fit**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026610194-Stretch-your-images-document-Stretch-vs-Fit-vs-Zoom-your-content).

Please note that these ratios apply to any app, not just images and videos.

#### **My documents (PowerPoint, PDFs) g****o through pages too fast! How can I fix this?**

When selecting a document, there is an additional setting, called **Duration**:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/45708705963667)

This shows how long on your split screen your document will display. However, please note that this duration applies to ***the entire document****.*Meaning, if you have a slideshow with 10 slides, and set this duration for 10 seconds, each slide will only display for 1 second.

If you want to display each slide for 10 seconds, you will need to set your duration to 100 seconds: 10 slides divided by 10 seconds per slide.
