## Free Plan Limitations

### What Content Might Be Affected When Moving from a Paid Plan or Trial to a Free Plan?

If you’ve created assets or playlists in OptiSigns while on your free trial or while using a paid account and you choose to downgrade to a Free Plan, some of these may be affected.

Certain apps will be unavailable for use on a Free Plan. These apps are marked with a red lock.

![example app with lock icon in upper right corner](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33940834606867)

You will be unable to create assets using these apps while on a Free Plan. Any assets created using one of these apps during your trial or as a paid subscriber will still exist on the OptiSigns backend, but will be unable to display on your screens.

If your used storage is more than 1GB, after your account is downgraded to a Free Plan, you will have limited ability to create new assets. You will need to delete some files to free up available storage for your free plan.

You will lose access to certain features that are not available on a Free plan, such as using Schedules, SplitScreens, or widgets in designer. Warning messages will appear when you attempt to use those features.
