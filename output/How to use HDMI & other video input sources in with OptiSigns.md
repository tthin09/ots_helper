## What You'll Need

* An OptiSigns **[Standard plan or higher](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing).**
  + **NOTE:** Running the Live TV app only requires a Standard plan, but running the Live TV with Ads app requires an **Engage** **plan or higher**.
* **Video source**. This is most commonly a TV set-top box, but could be anything from a video game console to a streaming device.
* **USB video capture card**. This transforms the video into a usable format for the OptiSigns Live TV app.
* Device running OptiSigns. Currently, we only support **Windows PCs** (with an Intel i5 CPU at minimum) and **[OptiSigns Pro](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-digital-signage-player) or [ProMax players](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-promax-signage-player)**. Ensure you are running the latest version of the OptiSigns app.
* A **screen** to display it on.

You'll connect it up in this fashion: **Video Source → USB Capture Card → Player / PC → Screen**.

### **That's all! Congratulations!**

When you assign the SplitScreen to your WIndows Mini PC it will play the video input and other splitscreen content.

Troubleshooting common problems:

1) Make sure your USB device is working and showing content in other apps like [OBS Streaming](https://obsproject.com).

2) Troubleshoot, change video, audio sources by go to OptiSigns Player's side menu select Live TV input sources.
