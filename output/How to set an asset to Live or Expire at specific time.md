# How to set an asset to Live or Expire at specific time

There are situations where your organization may need to set an asset to be shown on your screen at a specific date and time or for a period of time. Live and Expire feature is built for that purpose. Once you set the Live and Expire up on an asset, you can put it in any of your schedule, playlist or directly assigned to your screen or a zone in a splitscreen, the asset will only be shown during the period of time defined as live. When it is out of the defined live period, the asset will be skipped during content playback. You can also set it to repeat as well.

\
What does that mean for you?

A common use of Live/Expire feature is for holiday promotion like below. Or if you have contents prepared in advance for birthday or anniversary celebration and only want it to show on that day.

*Retail Example:  Your retail establishment has a standard schedule of marketing assets all week but on special holidays (e.g. Black Friday), there is a time sensitive promotion that needs to be shown in the week of Black Friday only, it begins to show when the week starts and no longer show after the week ends. You can also set your promotion daily, weekly, monthly or yearly repeat.*

**[Update: 7/21/2022 | Note: Added feature to set schedule recurring asset live & expire i.e. every Wed]**
